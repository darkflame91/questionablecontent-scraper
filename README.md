# questionablecontent-scraper
Downloads all the comic images from Questionable Content for offline reading.

This script has not been under version control(till now!)

This script requires the requests python library.

This can be read as is, but I prefer rar'ing them, changing the extension to .cbr, and reading them on a comic book reader.

TODO:
- Store images in folders in groups of 100's or 1000's
- Try finding a way to convert to cbr programmatically
